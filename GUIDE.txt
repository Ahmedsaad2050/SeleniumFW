Testing Automation framework using Java with Selenium:
I made this framework as a sample for testing Wikipedia website for some features.

This Framework is an implementation for the Front-End Testing Automation using Gradle.


1)Download and install the java SDK/JDK
2)Clone the project: https://github.com/Ahmedsaad2050/SeleniumFW.git
3)Start running tests using the gradlew file in the project directory from Command Line.

Helping Instructions:
*Open CMD window, navigate to the project path(ex."cd c:\Workplace\SeleniumFW") and then Type "gradlew build" for building and running the tests.

*For reviewing the testing results and the report: navigate to this path "cd c:\....\SeleniumFW\build\reports\tests\test\classes"

You'll find the file "wikiPac.Wiki.html" with the testing status.
