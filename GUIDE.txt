*******Testing Automation framework using Java with Selenium:
I made this framework as a sample for testing Wikipedia website for some features and it's like a template if you would like to have an Automation QA Front End jumpstart.

This Framework is an implementation for the Front-End Testing Automation using Gradle,Java and Selenium.


#Steps to run:

1)Download and install the java JDK/JRE
2)Clone the project: https://github.com/Ahmedsaad2050/SeleniumFW.git
3)Start running tests using the gradlew file in the project directory from Command Line.

#Helping Instructions:
  *Open CMD window, navigate to the project path(ex."cd c:\Workplace\SeleniumFW") and then Type "gradlew build" for building and running the tests.

  *For reviewing the testing results and the report: navigate to this path "cd c:\Workplace\SeleniumFW\build\reports\tests\test\classes"

  You'll find the file "wikiPac.Wiki.html" with the testing status.


#Another used gradle commands:
  gradlew build
  gradlew clean
  gradlew test

Good Luck :)
